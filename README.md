Mode 1 code refactor

When encountering a webiste, you wan to be able to access is in the best way possible. Being able to make this website accessible for absolutely eveyone was the goal. Being able to click on the links and for it to take you to the information you need is what i would want in a website. ALso, being able to have a screen reader is also very helpful.

In the process of making this website a lot more acccessible, I was able to not only apply these usefl tools but learn me commands as well.

 Accessability was key and the motivation throughout my entire project and was seeing if anthing needed to be clean-up as well!
